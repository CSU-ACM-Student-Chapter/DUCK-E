Grabbing Questions
TODO: Get questions from any website into its own CSV file for a given topic. 
TODO: Add conditional in question for channel, if already open question, cancel and send a 'cancellation' statement
"There is already an open question in this channel./n{Question}" 
TODO: Allow users to select their subject, this subject will then decide which table to obtain question from.
    Subjects: All, Tech-Trivia, Algorithms, Networking, CyberSecurity, AI & Machine Learning

TODO: Look into putting functionality to grab a random question into a different file

Checking Questions
TODO: Add functionality to grab answers from user. If a conditional is already in place to only allow 1 question per channel. 
        Then this should only need to check the channel to obtain the current question.
