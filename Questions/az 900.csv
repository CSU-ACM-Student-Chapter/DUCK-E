"You plan to implement an Azure database solution. 
You need to implement a database solution that meets the following 
requirements:  
• Can add data concurrently from multiple regions 
• Can store JSON documents 
Which database service should you deploy?  
Answer – Azure Cosmos DB 
Explanation: 
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service provided by 
Microsoft. It is designed to scale horizontally and handle large volumes of data with low 
latency across multiple regions. With Cosmos DB, you can choose from different 
consistency levels to meet your specific application needs and ensure data availability and 
responsiveness. 
Cosmos DB is a NoSQL database that supports multiple data models, including document 
data model, key-value, graph, column-family, and more. The document data model is ideal 
for storing and querying JSON documents as it provides schema flexibility, allowing you to 
store varying data structures within the same collection. 
By deploying Azure Cosmos DB, you can achieve global distribution of data, enabling you to 
add data concurrently from multiple regions while ensuring.

"Your company has virtual machines (VMs) hosted in Microsoft Azure. 
The VMs are located in a single Azure virtual network named VNet1. 
The company has users that work remotely. The remote workers require

• C. Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN. 
• D. Configure DirectAccess on a Windows Server 2012 server VM. 
• E. Configure a Multi-Site VPN 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
To provide access for remote workers who need to connect to the virtual machines (VMs) on 
VNet1, you should configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN. Point-to-Site VPN enables individual 
remote clients to securely connect to an Azure virtual network over the public internet. This
